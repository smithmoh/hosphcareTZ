    question: 'How do I get billed for services?',
    answer: 'We accept payment from most insurance companies for equipment and supplies. In some cases, your insurance may limit the number and type of supplies, require prior authorization, and have co-payments and/or deductibles. It is your responsibility to notify us of any changes in your insurance coverage. Rental equipment is charged on a monthly basis in most cases. Some types of equipment may be purchased rather than rented. Please contact our billing office if you would like to have your equipment changed to a purchase. Insurance verification is done prior to providing you with equipment/supplies. We will file a claim directly with your insurance company on your behalf, with the physicianâ€™s order, and request payment be sent directly to Sparrow Medical Supply.'
